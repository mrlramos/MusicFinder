# MusicFinder

Repository for personal use, used to compare tracks from a playlist in beatport with a folder containing the same tracks. The ultimate goal is to know the difference between the tracks of both playlists, to equalize them


To use this application, you must set 3 variables:

- 1 - "folderPath": setting the location of your tracks
- 2 - "txtFilePath": setting the location of your text file extracted from Beatport
- 3 - "trackNumber": setting the number of tracks you have in Beatport's playlist(same in item 2)
